PROBLEM 3: NESTLE TOLL HOUSE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES

The following questions concern the iconic Nestle Toll House Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe, shown below:

ORIGINAL NESTLE TOLLHOUSE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES

2 1/4 cups all- purpose flour

1 tsp. baking soda

1 tsp. salt

1 cup (2 sticks) butter or margarine, softened

3/4 cup granulated sugar

3/4 cup packed brown sugar

1 tsp. vanilla extract

2 large eggs

2 cups NESTLE TOLLHOUSE  Semi-Sweet Chocolate Morsels

1 cup chopped nuts

How much glutenin?
Glutenin (molecular weight: 75,000 g/mol) makes up ~60% of the protein in all-purpose flour. Assuming that all-purpose flour is 10% protein by weight, about how many molecules of glutenin are in this recipe? According to WolframAlpha, the density of flour is 0.59 g/mL.

```{r}
#1 cup = 236.588 ml

mass_flour = 236.588*2.25*0.59
protein_mass = 0.1*mass_flour

glutenin_mass =0.6*protein_mass

(glutenin_mass/75000)*6.02*10^23
```
